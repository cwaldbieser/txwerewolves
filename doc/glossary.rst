    werewolf: 

        A cursed individual who assumes the form of wolf-like creature at   
        night, especially during the full moon.  Werewolves prey on the
        living, and they possess great ferocity and strength in their
        cursed forms.  They are vulnerable in their human forms during the
        daylight hours.
